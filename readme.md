Lovely little small AngularJs with ASP.Net Web API Services.

It demonstrates a few good things:

- Error handling and propagation between Server / Client [Services, and Controller]
  Read Ricks blog for further confusion ;-) https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2014/Oct/24/AngularJs-and-Promises-with-the-http-Service
- Custom notification service e.g. wrapper around Toastr
- Custom little loading indicator for text [my own try using annimation.css and angular directive]

in addtion to all the other goodies
- Dependency injection using Unity
- Repositories
- Unit tests for the controllers
etc
